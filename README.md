SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help developers write clean and maintainable code. They are:

- Single-Responsibility Principle: A class or module should have one and only one reason to change.
- Open-Closed Principle: A class or module should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: A subclass or derived class should be substitutable for its base or parent class.
- Interface Segregation Principle: A client should not be forced to depend on methods that it does not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
